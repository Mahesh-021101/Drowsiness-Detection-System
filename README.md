# Drowsiness Detection System

The drowsiness detection system helps the individual stay awake by sending an alert (beeping sound) when it classifies them as drowsy. The proposed system tackles the issue raised by the survey by incorporating a super resolution convolutional neural network to get a high-resolution image from the low-resolution video input. It 
also incorporates a multi-branch low-light enhancement network to improve the videos lighting conditions. This enhanced video is then given as an input to the drowsiness detection algorithm  thus improving its accuracy even for low-resolution and poor lighting videos.
